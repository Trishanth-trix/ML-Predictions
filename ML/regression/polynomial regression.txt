polynomial regression
----------------------
polynomial equation for this is y=ax^2+bx+c




for degree=0: y=constant
for degree=1: y=mx+c
for degree=2: y=ax^2+bx+c

this polynomial regression is used in non linear relationship.

example:population,virus spreading


to print rows and colums in the data set we will use
syntax:
dataset_var.iloc[no of rows,no of col]
ex:
var=df.iloc[0: , 0:]
the above will print all the rows starting from 0 and all the columns starting from 0.

it is udes to extract x and y values to plot the graph.

#to import polynomial regression 

from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
#we are changing degree so that we are going to use fit_transform(x)

poly_x=poly.fit_transform(x)

poly_reg.predict(poly.fit_transform([[11]]))
