regression
------------
regression is a statistical method to understand the relationship between two or more variables.
there are 3 types of regressions

they are 
1.linear-->predictive model to 	predict the linear 	relationship b/w the variables
2.polynomial
3.logistic

1.linear:
---------
	a.single linear regression->only single dependent and independent values
	ex:age-independent,premium-dependent
	b.multiple linear regression-> single dependent values and multiple independent values
	ex:house price prediction
	area,no.of bedrooms,age-->independent values.
	price of the house-->dependent value
* here we will be importing seaborn as sns package

code for prediction
import pandas as pd
var1=pd.DataFrame({"age":[25,30,35,40,45],"premium":[18000,32000,42000,47000,55000]})


->import sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

#we will also use "sklearn.linear_model" package by importing "LinearRegression" we will be predicting the values.

->linear_model=LinearRegression()

#linear_reg_model=LinearRegression() [we will be using same name as method(LinearRegression())]
#now we are going to train our linear_model to predict the values.
#for training the model we use "fit" followed by column names

->linear_model.fit(var1[["age"]],var1[["premium"]])

# now our linear_model is ready to predict the values
#for testing the linear model we will use the below line of code by passing age as parameter.

->linear_model.predict([[32]])
# gives the predicted premium value for age 32.

#the whole prediction is done based on straight line formula that is (y=mx+c)
where y= value to be predicted that is premium
      m= co-efficient
      x=age that is input value
      c=intercept
#to find co-efficient value we should use the below line
->linear_model.coef_
#to find intercept value we should use the below line
->linear_model.intercept_
->x refers to age
->y refers to premium
